# Advanced Swift - Part 2

---
## Purpose
The second part of the "Advanced Swift" section will serve as a place to keep my notes regarding Swift as I work through building the project. The project for this part will not be served remotely in this repository as the skeleton was acquired via the Udemy Course (below) and I only plan to keep projects that I worked on from the start on here.

Follows the [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/ios-12-app-development-bootcamp/)

## Interesting Concepts (Notes)
A section to list any new, interesting concepts that I may come across while working on this part's project.
