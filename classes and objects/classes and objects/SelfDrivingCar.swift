// By using ": Car", we make it so that SelfDrivingCar inherits the properties from the Car class
// SelfDrivingCar is now a subclass from the Car superclass
class SelfDrivingCar : Car {

    // Override function
    override func drive() {
        print("Your \(color) self-driving car is now driving to: \(destination)")
